## 🆕 **LATEST IMPLEMENTATION: LISTING OWNERSHIP MIDDLEWARE**

### **What Was Added:**

1. **Custom Middleware**: `CheckListingOwnership`

   - Automatically verifies listing ownership
   - Applied to update and delete routes
   - Returns proper HTTP status codes (403, 404, 401)

2. **Enhanced Frontend Error Handling**:

   - Specific error messages for different scenarios
   - User-friendly permission messages
   - Proper HTTP status code handling

3. **Route Protection**:
   ```php
   // Protected routes (owner only)
   PUT /api/listings/{listing}    -> middleware(['auth:api', 'listing.owner'])
   DELETE /api/listings/{listing} -> middleware(['auth:api', 'listing.owner'])
   ```

### **Security Benefits:**

- ✅ **Data Protection**: Users can only modify their own listings
- ✅ **Access Control**: Centralized ownership verification
- ✅ **Consistency**: Same security logic across all protected endpoints
- ✅ **Maintainability**: Easy to modify ownership rules
